# About Me

## Biography

ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! I'm **Pakagrong Lebel** half Thai/Aussie ,full-stack developer, AI/ML tinkerer, and certified code nerd. at [Unit for Social & Environmental Research (USER)](https://sea-user.org/) at [Chiang Mai University](https://www.cmu.ac.th/en/). Back in 2016-ish, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree at the [Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT)](https://www.rmit.edu.au/). By night, youâ€™ll find me building passion projects with Next.js, Python, TypeScript, React, and a healthy dose of caffeine.

I love turning complex problems into elegant, user-friendly applications. Whether it's creating APIs that streamline data collection (increasing efficiency by 30%! ðŸš€), optimising large databases on AWS, or transforming research models into interactive web apps, Iâ€™m all about making tech work for people.

My current research interests primarily focus on understanding and enhancing the continuity, generalisability, efficiency, and other key properties of machine learning. I am also interested in large multimodal models.

## Tech I vibe with:
React, Next.js, Python, TypeScript, Fabric.js, AWS, Pandas, and anything that makes my terminal feel like home. I also love to build anything with Raspberry Pi.
