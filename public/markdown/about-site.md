# About This Site

This site is inspired by macOS [Big Sur](https://www.apple.com/in/macos/big-sur/) and [Catalina](https://www.apple.com/bw/macos/catalina/), developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) and [UnoCSS](https://uno.antfu.me/), and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The icons are sourced from [macOS Icons](https://macosicons.com/#/) and [sindresorhus/file-icon-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/file-icon-cli).

The source code is hosted [here](https://github.com/pakagronglb/playground-macos).

Big thanks to [Renovamen](https://github.com/Renovamen/playground-macos) for the original project inspiration!
